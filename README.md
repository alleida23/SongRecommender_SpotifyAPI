# Spotify TuneTailor: Shaping Custom Song Recommendations
## with Spotify API and KMeans Clustering

Welcome to the Spotify Song Recommender project!

This ongoing project uses Spotify's tools and a technique called KMeans Clustering to suggest personalized songs. What sets this project apart is that it doesn't just pick one song â€“ it uses smart methods to suggest a couple of songs. And sometimes, it might include some light-hearted comments along the way... 

This README will guide you through how it works and what we're learning along the way. Let's explore making your music experience more personal and maybe have a bit of fun along the journey!
